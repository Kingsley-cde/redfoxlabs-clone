      <p>Why are Linux Security modules so crucial?</p>

        If you have a Linux distribution and you are operating a server on it,
        you will undoubtedly want to provide the highest level of security
        available to ensure that it runs smoothly and maintains its integrity.
        However, as we all know, there is no such thing as flawless security;
        developers will continue to make errors, and hackers will always find
        new and devious ways to exploit your server and obtain access. Once
        gaining access there will be another security layer by default made by
        unix systems based on discretionary access control
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control"
          >(DAC)</a
        >
        which has proven not be reliable and inadequate to provide strong system
        security, if attackers manage to get access as privileged user or made
        their way to one through privilege escalation, they will be free to do
        whatever they want on the server, thus having another layer of security
        is mandatory and it’s the problem that <b>LSMs</b> were made to solve.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>What is an LSM?</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>LSMs</b> or Linux Security Modules are just a framework that offer
        security checks. They are compiled directly into the kernel. Unlike the
        default permissions system of the Unix, <b>LSMs</b> work based on a
        Mandatory access control (<b>MAC</b>>) which describes to the users the
        actions that they can do instead of what they can't and there will be an
        admin responsible for this security policy. <b>LSMs</b> work by adding
        hook extensions to the kernel that get triggered with the access to
        important kernel objects like inodes, task structures, credentials, and
        interprocess communication objects. There were several attempts for the
        best way to implement <b>MAC</b> into the kernel and the first one was
        <b>SELinux</b> presented by the <b>NSA</b> in 2001 but nothing was
        decided yet and Linus Torvalds asked the community to make it a module.
        Few years later <b>SELinux</b> became a widely used <b>LSM</b> but the
        community kept working on other modules which led to the appearance of
        <b>AppArmor, Tomoyo …</b>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Design of LSM</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To have a better understanding on how <b>LSMs</b> work, we should take a
        deep dive into their architecture and design. The goal of <b>LSM</b> was
        trying to find the most efficient way to add a mandatory access control
        module while imposing the fewest possible changes to the kernel and it
        has been done through the use of hooks. When a user performs an action
        that requires access to the kernel’s internal objects thus provoking
        system calls, it first passes through the kernel logic and errors checks
        then the <b>UNIX</b> discretionary access controls, after this the
        kernel will give or deny access but with a linux security module being
        present, this flow will has to first pass by another layer just before
        providing the access to the internal object, an <b>LSM </b>hook makes a
        call to the module asking Is this access ok ? and after the module goes
        through its policy it returns <b>‘Yes’</b> or <b>‘No’</b> hence granting
        access or denying the access. The following graph represents the
        <b>LSM Hook Architecture</b>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As shown in the Figure above , the <b>LSM</b> design is fairly simple
        and answers the security requirements but due to this simplicity,
        <b>LSM</b> hooks are primarily restrictive i.e if the kernel was about
        to grant access to an object the <b>LSM</b> may deny that access if it
        contradicts the policy, however if that process didn’t pass the checks
        before the hook, the <b>LSM</b> is not even consulted. In order to
        support this logic, <b>LSM</b> provides some actions through permissive
        hooks that can grant access the kernel was about to deny. It is done
        after doing a simple <b>DAC </b>check then a <b>DAC</b> override with
        the permissive <b>LSM</b> hook just like it’s presented in the figure
        below :
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In case the user's request for access was rejected by the kernel it can
        be overridden by the permissive hook. These hooks are limited to the
        extent that the kernel already consults the
        <b>POSIX capable </b>function.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>LSM Examples</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are multiple LSMs and each one is characterized by its advantages
        and inconveniences, and we’re going to present some of them, highlight
        their qualities and compare them. It’s worth pointing out that only a
        single LSM can be used at a time as it assumes it has exclusive access
        to the security context pointers and security identifiers embedded in
        protected kernel objects.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li><b>SELinux</b> (Security-Enhanced Linux)</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        We have to start with the most sophisticated Linux
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control"
          >Mandatory Access Control</a
        >
        (MAC) System, which is SELinux. SELinux was initially released as a
        collaboration between Red Hat and the National Security Agency; it is
        supported today by many Linux distributions. Its ultimate goal is to
        monitor running processes, by ensuring that they respect a number of
        predefined rules, and also by tagging all of files, directories,
        sockets, and processes with an appropriate SELinux security context to
        follow.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>SELinux </b>only grants access if the administrator writes a specific
        policy to do so, which is called the least-privilege model, it comes
        with three different modes:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>Strict mode</b>: restriction of access according to the SELinux
        rules.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>Permissive mode</b>: access will not be blocked but errors as
        recorded to the logs, it can be thought of as debugging mode.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Disabled mode</b>: as its name refers to, it does nothing.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This security module is known for its complex structure and the
        capability to establish any possible rule or policy, which offers higher
        levels of security. However, it is not so intelligible to all people,
        many of them find it difficult to set up, to manage and to troubleshoot,
        and these are the main reasons for them to abandon it and opt for other
        LSMs, which we will be discussing some next.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>AppArmor</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        AppArmor is a linux kernel security module, offered as an alternative to
        SELinux, it is available on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server,
        <b>openSUSE</b> and other platforms. Same as SELinux,
        <b>AppArmor</b> supports the Type Enforcement security model, which is a
        type of mandatory access control, based on rules where subjects
        (processes or users) are allowed to access objects (files, directories,
        sockets, etc.). Unlike SELinux, which is based on applying labels to
        files, AppArmor uses configuration files and pathnames to grant,
        restrict and deny access, and we call them security profiles, which are
        equivalent to SELinux security policies and look more user-friendly.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In addition to that, AppArmor is filesystem-agnostic which means that it
        supports any filesystem, while SELinux doesn’t provide access control
        for files mounted via NTFS. For all of these reasons, proponents of
        AppArmor claim that it is less complex and easier for the average user
        to learn, and also the fact that it requires fewer modifications to work
        with existing systems.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        On the other hand, this LSM ensures fewer operations compared to
        SELinux, for instance this last one separates containers by default and
        controles more operations on a system. This level of control is not
        possible with AppArmor because it lacks
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_categories_security"
          >Multi-Category Security</a
        >
        (MCS). In addition, not having
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_security">
          Multi-Level Security</a
        >
        (MLS) means that AppArmor cannot be used in highly secure environments.
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li><b>Smack</b>: simple; label based</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The acronym of Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel, it is a
        simple mandatory access control system, it is included in the Linux
        mainline kernel. SMACK was born due to the complexities of SELinux,
        according to its designers, it was designed with simplicity as its
        primary goal, with embedded systems in mind and for securing
        Internet-connected devices. As a result, it is easier to configure and
        maintain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Since it’s a MAC system, meaning it is governed by a central policy and
        not by system users, it works best with file systems that support
        extended attributes. SMACK uses the same underlying kernel
        infrastructure as SELinux, but reduces the granularity to make system
        development, configuration, and administration practical and flexible.
        Although that makes its tools not as rich as those available for use
        with SELinux.

      <br />
      <p>Real world Scenarios require the use of LSM</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Due to the protection they give and the different attacks they have
        helped stop or at least mitigate the potential damage, <b>LSMs</b> have
        become quite popular in the professional world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>This impact can be seen in a variety of fields :</p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Network / Web:</b></p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An <b>LSM</b> is most useful with programs that provide an attack
        surface, which is to say,
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        network-accessible daemons. For example running an apache server which
        with no doubt one day a vulnerability will get discovered and exploited
        and here we can see the power of <b>LSM</b>. An apache DoS vulnerability
        where an attacker can cause httpd to send a signal to an arbitrary
        process and maybe crash it was successfully mitigated with the help of
        <b>SELinux</b>. Another scenario where a Linux security module comes in
        handy is mitigating the damage made by configuration mistakes like in a
        DNS server where the servers often replicate information between each
        other and attackers may use zone transfers to update the DNS server with
        false information. Unrestricted file reading/writing, which can lead to
        stealing ssh keys and hence server access, is another form of attack
        that LSM has helped to prevent. If <b>LSM</b> is configured to disallow
        the "Allow $(service name) service to read and write files in user home
        directories” policy, the exploit will fail and the policy violation will
        be logged.
      </p>

      <p>Privilege escalation:</p>

      <p>
        Before the appearance of Linux Security modules, if attackers gain
        access to a server, especially with root privileges, they are free to do
        whatever they want in the environment. This is a problem that
        <b>LSMs</b> helped prevent in the first place where many root access
        vulnerabilities were failing due to the security policy and reduce the
        damage in the second place, that doesn’t mean getting root access is not
        dangerous but it’s less devastating. The thing about <b>LSM</b> is that
        each process is running in its domain, isolated and limited by the
        permissions given by the sysadmin in the <b>LSM</b> policy rules, so if
        a process is compromised, it will only be able to do what the policy
        allows thus if the policy was well written, it will not let the process
        do actions considered as dangerous or malicious.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Android:</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Android is an excellent example of a real-world scenario in which
        <b>LSM</b>, specifically SELinux, made a significant difference. Prior
        to Android 4.3, security in Android was dependent on application
        sandboxes, with each sandbox specified by a UID that defined its rights.
        After Android 4.3, SELinux was introduced and applied to further define
        the limits of each android sandbox, hence defining what each program can
        do, i.e. any application will not be allowed to conduct an action that
        requires a system call if it is not listed in the security policy. The
        implementation of SELinux helped also reduce the attack surface which
        results in an attacker needing to find more vulnerabilities in a smaller
        surface.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Practical SELinux example</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In order to get a good grasp of LSMs, or SELinux in particular, the
        following example will show how effective SELinux can be to marginally
        reduce the attack surface when running vulnerable software on a server.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Scenario</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Let’s suppose we have a CentOS server hosting a simple but vulnerable
        PHP script on an Apache HTTP server.
      </p>

      <p>This is the code for the mentioned script <b>(`_index.php_`)</b> :</p>

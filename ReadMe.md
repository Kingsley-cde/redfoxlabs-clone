# Code Labs Academy - Redfox Labs Clone

## Introduction

This is one of the project for Fundamentals Unit of the web development bootcamp offered by [Code Labs Academy](https://codelabsacademy.com/). In this unit, we learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap while providing challenges and homeworks for an optimal hands-on learning experience.

## Project Description

In this project, you will have to clone the landing page of the official [website](https://redfoxlabs.dev/) of Red Fox Labs using the Mobile First Approach.

The website should be fully-responsive and should look as close as possible to the official website.

To do this project, you need a decent understanding of Responsive Web Design.You can find all the assets in the [assets](./assets/) folder.

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Before doing anything, try to go throught the website and think of the optimal way of structuring your HTML.

2. Structure your content with HTML. Writing HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.

3. Start by designing the mobile version of the website.

4. Once the mobile version is done. You can jump into designing the desktop version.
